<!--
   In an effort to help everyone have a solid foundation of where to go to find some self-help,
   the UWROV will start adapting a style guideline to provide a organized structure for everyone
   to follow in order to produce readable and malleable code. Ideally, this should help create
   a fairly managable structure for new/future members to understand and build off of rather than
   recreating new projects from scratch every year. In addition to updating old code, this should
   help new projects have a baseline quality to follow in order to be recycled for the future.

         <p>Here is a page to learn and play around with code for everyone. Feel free to add onto the page with random code snippets but respect any code that anyone else is developing. In order to practice a "modular" program structure, make sure that everything written is independent of each other. For testing in the console, go into the developer tools. </p>

      This is where any of your "widgets" will go make sure to comment everything such as who wrote it and which javascript files will handle it. Also try to keep everything documented in the read me file.

<!--
  This is the index page for the GUI of the UWROV. The overall structure of the GUI is very simple.
  Each major HTML element should act as a single module in a sense that they can be easily added
  and removed without interfering with other modules. The details will be in the documentation.
  MAKE SURE TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE!
